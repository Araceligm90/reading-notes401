# RELATIONAL DATABASES & SQL


**1. What is a relational database?**

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables with predefined relationships between them.
In a relational database, data is structured in a tabular form, with rows representing individual records and columns
representing attributes or properties of those records.

The main idea behind a relational database is that it allows you to establish relationships between tables. These
relationships are defined through keys, which are unique identifiers that help establish connections between related
data in different tables. The most common type of key used is the primary key, which uniquely identifies each record in
a table.


Relational databases provide several benefits, including:

    a. Structured organization: Data is organized in a structured manner, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval.
    b. Data integrity: Relational databases enforce data integrity through constraints, such as unique key constraints,
        which ensure that data remains consistent.
    c. Scalability: They can handle large amounts of data and support complex queries and transactions.
    d. Data consistency: The relationships between tables help maintain data consistency and avoid redundant or
        duplicated data.



**2. What is SQL?**

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational
databases. It is the standard language for interacting with relational database management systems (RDBMS). SQL
provides a set of commands for performing tasks such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a database.

SQL allows you to perform various operations on a relational database, including:

    a. Data Querying: SQL enables you to retrieve specific data from one or more tables using the SELECT statement.
        You can specify conditions, sort the results, and aggregate data using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.
    b. Data Manipulation: SQL provides commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to modify data in the database. These
        commands allow you to add new records, update existing ones, or remove data from tables.
    c. Schema Definition: SQL allows you to create, modify, and delete the structure of a database using commands like
        CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE. You can define tables, specify relationships, and set constraints.
    d. Data Control: SQL provides commands for managing user access and permissions to the database. This includes
        creating users, granting or revoking privileges, and controlling data security.

Overall, relational databases and SQL provide a powerful and standardized approach for managing structured data
efficiently and effectively.
