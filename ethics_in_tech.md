#ETHICS IN TECH

### The code I am still ashamed of.

The above article talks about a young developer who is given the job of creating a
website for a pharmaceutical company. This website features a quiz, and the goal 
of said quiz is to advise young girls whether they should be taking a specific 
drug or not. However, the issue is that the quiz will advise you to take the 
drug no matter what your answers are. Only if you are already on the drug or 
allergic to it, you won't get a positive answer. 

The author shares that he doesn't think much about it at the beginning, but it 
is when a colleague of his sends him an article about a girl's death due to the
drug that he starts feeling uneasy. No longer after that he resigned. 

I hope I am never put in the position in my career where I have to agree to do 
something that goes against my ethics and moral. Unfortunately, sometimes
external circumstances will lead us to do so. For example, having to support 
your family and not being able to if you lose your job. 

With great power comes great responsibility.

### Ethical dilemma of self-driving cars

This second article talks about the dilemma of who should the self-driving cars
save when in an accident where it is unavoidable to save everyone. It gives a 
clear example: I am driving my car with my family in it and a kid jumps on the 
road. My options are to drive to one side and crash against a building, resulting
in me and my family getting hurt, running over the kid, or driving towards the
curve and run over other pedestrians. It is a tough one. 

Should the car software identify kids and elderly people and prioritize them 
over others? Or should we all be treated equally and choose the path where the
least people is harmed? Because that will probably be the kid that jumped on 
the road. 


It is a difficult decision and the issue still remains unsolved. 

It is logical to think that harming the least amount of people is the right 
answer, but creating a software that will choose who gets to live and who doesn't
cannot be an easy job.
