# Data Strucutes and Algorithms


**1. What is one of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**

Checking the inputs and outputs and then the amount of data that we will be dealing with and how often will this data be acceessed. 


**2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**

Every recursive funtion has two parts: the base case and the recursive case. The base case is where the function doesn't call itself, while the recursive case is where the functions does call itself and goes into an infinite loop.
