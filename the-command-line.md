# THE COMMAND LINE (AKA THE TERMINAL)


**1. Basics of the command line.**

    a. You can find out where you are by typing 'pwd' (print working directory).
    b. You can access a folder by typinc 'cd' (change directory) and then typing the name of the folder.
    c. You can see the content of the folder by typing 'ls' (list of contents). 
    d. 'Ls' will only display the visible files. If you want to see the hidden files within a folder, you must type 
    'ls -a".
    e. To go to the privous folder, type "cd .."
    f. To create a new directory type 'mkdir' and the directory name.
    g. To create a new file type 'touch' and the name of the file and the extension.
    h. To remove a directory type 'rmdir'. However, this will onyl work if the directory doesn't contain any file.
    i. To remove a directory that contains further directories or files, type the following command 'rm -f". Keep in
    mind though that this command will remove the directory completely and you won't be able to recover it.
