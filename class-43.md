# CLASS 43 READING NOTES


## Open Source Software (OSS) Contribution:

<br>

**What is OSS?**


Open source software thrives on collaborative efforts, where developers from around the world contribute their skills, 
insights, and time to collectively create and enhance software that is freely accessible and modifiable by anyone. These 
contributions play a critical role in shaping the digital landscape, promoting innovation, and driving technological 
progress.

**What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to OSS?**

By participating in open source projects, developers not only refine their coding abilities but also contribute to a 
global community, improving software quality and expanding its functionality.
Moreover, a commitment to the principles of open collaboration and the desire to give back to the community make many 
developers contribute. The opportunity to work on new technologies, gain exposure, and collaborate with 
other skilled developers offers a chance for professional growth. Moreover, contributing to open source projects allows 
developers to show their skills, give a boost to their resumes, and establish a strong online presence, which could 
potentially lead to job opportunities.

**Personal reflection:**

After poking around a few open-source repositories for Lab 44, I have to admit that jumping into open-source 
contributions still feels a bit overwhelming to me. I'm not entirely confident that my skills are up to par for 
meaningful collaboration and contribution to these projects yet. Nonetheless, I'm hopeful that as I continue to grow as 
a developer, I'll eventually be able to join in on some open-source projects.
