# ENGINEERING READINGS


**1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**

Because of my background I feel as comfortable behing the screen as I do selling the product. I am actually very persuasive.

I am also used to (and love) working with teams, so I would feel as comfortable working by myself as I would do with a team.

I am very creative and I love to create fun things.

**2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**

Everyone keeps on talking about how good ChatGPT is to help you get un stuck, so 401 has to be the year where I start using this tool.

I won't let more than 15 minutes pass without asking a TA for help.

And something that I already do but may not work on this 401 as I have nothing on Python, is looking at my old code.
